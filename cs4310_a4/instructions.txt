Instructions for Running the Shell

1. When inside the CS4310_a4 directory, type "make" into the command line. This will compile the code from a Makefile into an executable file called "shell_make".
2. Execute the file shell_make by typing ./shell_make into the command line.
3. Our command line should work at this point. It will show an introduction of the command line for a brief second. At that point, you can do one of the following commands:
 cd    - Change directory
 pwd   - Present working directory
 mkdir - Make Directory
 rmdir - Removes Directory in current working directory
 ls    - List all files in directory
 cp    - Copies files into other files
 help  - Names all commands that are usable
 hello - Says "hello" to you
 exit  - Leaves shell with a "Goodbye"
 color - Allows the user to change the color of the command line
 clear - Clears the screen
 It can also run executables.
